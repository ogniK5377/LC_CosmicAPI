# LC_CosmicAPI
This is mostly a very WIP API I'm using mainly for personal stuff. I'm mainly tailoring it to combine common functionality to all my personal mods I make for my friends to play!

I've still got quite a bit planned but i'm not working 24/7 on it and just having fun with it. If you find it useful, can make improvements or just want to use it as a reference. Feel free! I wouldn't mind if you drop a pull request too!
